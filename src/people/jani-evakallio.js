    "Jani, a veteran of the Frontend Framework wars, has earned his battle scars writing JavaScript on the bleeding edge for the last decade. Today, he leads a team building cross-stack React mobile and web apps at Formidable London.\n\nHe gets childishly excited about beautiful user interactions and design tools. In his spare time, he performs improvised comedy and speaks at conferences advocating for the React ecosystem, particularly React Native and GraphQL.",
